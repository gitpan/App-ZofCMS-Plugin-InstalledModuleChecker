App-ZofCMS-Plugin-InstalledModuleChecker

The module is a utility plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that provides means to check for whether
or not a particular module is installed on the server and get module's version if it is
installed.

The idea for this plugin came to me when I was constantly writing "little testing scripts"
that would tell me whether or not a particular module was installed on the crappy
server that I have to work with all the time.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
